# Parts

All parts for the maxmix controller can be found and purchased online.
Links to the parts are provided below but feel free to purchase them elsewhere.
When looking for alternatives, just make sure the part specifications match to avoid any issues.

## 3D Print

The enclosure for the controller is made of a couple of 3D printed parts and can be downloaded from [Prusaprinters.org](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/31336-maxmix).

If you don't have a 3D printer, I recommend using a community printing service such as [Treatstock](https://www.treatstock.com/), it is the most cost effective method.

### Soldering

Soldering has been kept down to a minimum but some is required.
If you are unable to solder, you can try alternative methods such as conductive glue: [AliExpress][part-conductive-glue-ae], [Amazon][part-conductive-glue-am]
