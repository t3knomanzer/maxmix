- An available USB 2.0 or greater port.
- A Maxmix device.

# Desktop Application

{% include alert.html text="It is recommended that you install the desktop application before you plug-in your device for the first time." %}

1. Download the latest version of the desktop application.
2. Double click on the installer and follow the instructions on the screen.
3. Plug-in your device now and wait for Windows to recognize it.
4. Launch the application either from the Windows start menu or the shortcut on your desktop.

The application should now be running and you should see the Maxmix icon in the **windows taskbar**.
You can double-click or right click on the icon to access the application.

## Attempt to automatically reinstall the USB driver

1. In **Windows Device Manager** locate the device, right click on it and select **Uninstall device** then press **Uninstall** in the dialog.
2. Unplug the device and reboot your computer.
3. After Windows starts up, plug-in your device again and wait for it to be recognized. It should now show up in **Windows Device Manager** as **CH340**.

### Install the USB driver manually

If your nano is still showing as an unrecognized device, it's probably because it uses a chinese clone of the FTDI USB chip which unfortunately does not work with the automatic driver finding functionality in Windows. So you will have to install the driver yourself.

1. Unplug the device.
2. Download the [CH341SER.zip](/uploads/CH341SER.zip) archize, unzip it to a known location then double click on **SETUP.EXE**.
3. When prompted click **Install**. Once completed, close the installer.
4. Open **Windows Device Manager**
5. Plug the device, it should now appears in Ports (COM & LPT) has **USB-SERIAL CH340**. If it's still undetected, try to reboot your computer and check again.
6. You can now delete the unzipped install folder.
