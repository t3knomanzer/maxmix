# Quick Start (1.3.x)

You've built your controller and installed the software. It's time to start using it!

## Actions

The Maxmix controller supports 4 different actions, **tap**, **double tap**, **hold** and **rotate**.

**Tap** is when you press and release the button once.
It is used to cycle through the different screens of the current mode.

**Double tap**, when you **tap** the button twice quickly.
It will perform a special action, specific to each mode.

**Hold**, when you press the button and hold it down for 1 second.
Used to cycle through the different modes available.

**Rotate**, can be either clockwise or counter-clockwise.
To increase or decrease the selected value.

## Modes

Maxmix has a few different modes of operation, each mode is designed and optimized for a particular use case.
The modes available as well as the current mode selected can be seen at the bottom of the screen.

**Tap** once to enter the **selection screen**.

Here you can **rotate** the knob to cycle through all output devices available and **tap** to swith your sound

### Input Mode

Just like output mode, input mode allows you to switch, adjust volume and toggle mute of your input devices.

### Application Mode

This mode is built for those wanting more granular control, allowing you to adjust the volume of each application individually.

It consists of 2 screens, the select screen and the edit screen.

In the **select screen** you can **rotate** to cycle through all applications running on your pc.
Once you find the application you'd like to edit, **tap** to go to the **edit screen**.

In the **edit screen**, **rotate** to adjust the volume of the application or **double tap** to mute/unmute.

### Mix Mode

Allows you to assign an application to each one of the 2 channels available. Once assigned, **rotating** will increase the volume of one while decreasing the other one at the same time.

It consists of 3 screens, **select screen a**, **select screen b** and **edit screen**.
You can identify the current selection screen is indicated by the letter **A** or **B** on the left hand side of the screen.

{% include image.html
    src="use/ui_modes_game_overlay_02.jpg"
    alt="Maxmix game mode select a screen"
    align="center"
    caption=""
%}

Select application **A**, **tap**, select **B** and **tap** to enter the **edit screen**.

Once you are in **edit screen**, **double tap** to set the volume of both applications to 50%. **Rotate** clockwise to increase application **A** while decreasing **B** or viceversa.
